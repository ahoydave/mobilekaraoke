# mobilekaraoke
The software for a pi-based mobile karaoke machine.

The basic idea is to take a folder of video files ripped from youtube and display a menu of them. When one is selected it gets played and then we're back to the menu.

The input is via the GPIO pins of the pi. Up, Down, Select, Cancel.
